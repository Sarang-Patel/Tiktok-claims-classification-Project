# TikTok Claims Classification

This project was completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**. The objective was to build a machine learning model that classifies TikTok videos as either **claims** or **opinions**, supporting efforts to address misinformation on social media.

## üìå Project Overview

Misinformation spreads rapidly on platforms like TikTok, making it important to detect misleading claims efficiently. This project applies supervised machine learning to video metadata to identify whether a video contains a claim.

Key highlights:

* Explored and cleaned TikTok video data.
* Built and compared classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Delivered stakeholder-focused recommendations for content moderation strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **Programming:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
* **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
* **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üöÄ Process & Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Examined dataset structure, variable distributions, and class balance.
   * Processed missing values and encoded categorical features.

2. **Model Development & Training:**

   * Implemented baseline model with Logistic Regression.
   * Experimented with ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost).
   * Tuned hyperparameters for improved performance.

3. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Compared models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
   * Selected the best-performing model for potential deployment.

4. **Insights & Recommendations:**

   * Communicated results in a stakeholder-friendly format.
   * Provided actionable strategies for improving claim detection.

## üìä Results

* **Best model:** Random Forest
* **Performance metrics:** Precision: 0.99, Recall: 0.99, F1: 0.99, Accuracy: 0.99
* Delivered insights that could help TikTok strengthen its moderation policies.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* Developed a **machine learning pipeline** from raw data to insights.
* Strengthened skills in **classification modeling and evaluation**.
* Practiced **data storytelling**, presenting technical results to non-technical stakeholders.
